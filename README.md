This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in a `SyntaxError`. The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected version. This is a subtle error that can be easily missed during code review, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.
